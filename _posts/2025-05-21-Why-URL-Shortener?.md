title: "Why I'm building a URL Shortener in Go and what I'll learn"
---

# URL Shortener sounds boring. Why?

Well, you're right! URL Shortener project indeed sounds boring, but I think it is a good starting point for me to learn more about
backend development. Because it is a straight forward project, you submit your long url and receive short url for that. Simple.

> Please keep it in mind that I'm an absolute beginner on this.

# Okay, but it won't improve your skill!

Not really, I expect to learn about designing an api, designing database schema, authentication and authorization, and much more.
It's a beginner's benefit I guess, every simple project teach me some new valuable skill. Anyway I plan this project to be more than
just a simple URL Shortener.

# Whoa you sound optimistic, how would you approach to finish this project?

I plan this project to be completed in approximately 20 days. Split this big chunk into small piece of works, so it'll be easier to track.
I expect a significant progress each day. This is going to be my first portofolio. I'm so exited about it.
